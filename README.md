# Web-Scrapping-Using-Beautifulsoup-in-Python

Web Scraping is the process of extracting data from a website and converting it in a form which is easy to read, understand and work on. The extracted data is stored in a CSV File, an Excel File or a Database. BeautifulSoup library is used to extract information from the HTML source code of a webpage. It parses HTML and XML documents and enables us to get data out of sequences of characters. In this project, I have scrapped football match data from the English Premier League. First of all, I downloaded the data using the library in Python called Requests. Then, parsed the data using BeautifulSoup and finally loaded it into a Pandas dataframe. matches.csv file contains the data I extracted from the English Premier League website.
